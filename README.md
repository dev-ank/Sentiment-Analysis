This is a web application which can classify a review into a positive or negative. It is trained on a basic Artificial Neural Network having test accuracy of
around 89%. It has two more sections in which we can see the wordcloud of the reviews selected from a particular website and a pie chart which shows the
percentage of positive and negative reviews. 

Selenium is used for scraping.

The frontend and backend of this web app is developed using Dash and database used is sqlite. 

Database is used just to store and retreive the scraped reviews.

For the modelling, Keras API is used and modelling is done on Google Colab.

This web app has been deployed on AWS t2.micro instance.
